## 📌 Project Objectives

- Predict revenue from a customer using regression models
- Predict whether a customer will return (churn analysis)
- Classify the category of hotel booking (luxury, midrange, budget)
- Compare predictive models including Lasso, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost
- Interpret results using visualizations and model evaluation metrics
