# Tourism & Hospitality Industry â€“ Predictive Analytics Project

- This repository contains the final project for ISOM 835: Predictive Analytics and Machine Learning (Suffolk University). 
It applies machine learning models to tourism data to solve real-world business problems using regression and classification techniques.
---

## Project Objectives
- Independently handle data preprocessing and modeling tasks
- Apply predictive models and evaluate their performance
- Interpret and communicate results effectively
- Reflect on model impact, interpretability, and ethical implications
- Develop a portfolio-ready GitHub project
---

##  What This Project Aims to Accomplish
Using data from global tourism and hospitality metrics, I want to address three business questions:
- Can we accurately predict tourism revenue based on travel behavior and hotel characteristics?
- Can we predict customer return based on their experience?
- Can we identify the purpose of visit based on traveler patterns?

## How to Run This Project
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab using the link below:
   [ðŸ”— Open Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13jBga0mskFeY6M4gKEQc_OMDmhQqihtT?usp=sharing)

2. Upload the CSV file (`Tourism_Hospitality_Industry_Analysis.csv`) to the Colab environment

3. Run cells from top to bottom to reproduce results:
   - Data cleaning & preprocessing
   - EDA with visualizations
   - Predictive modeling with 3 business questions
   - Performance evaluation and confusion matrices
