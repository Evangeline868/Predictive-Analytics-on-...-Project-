# Tourism & Hospitality Industry ‚Äì Predictive Analytics Project

- This repository contains the final project for ISOM 835: Predictive Analytics and Machine Learning (Suffolk University). 
It applies machine learning models to tourism data to solve real-world business problems using regression and classification techniques.
---

## Project Objectives
- Independently handle data preprocessing and modeling tasks
- Apply predictive models and evaluate their performance
- Interpret and communicate results effectively
- Reflect on model impact, interpretability, and ethical implications
- Develop a portfolio-ready GitHub project
---

##  What This Project Aims to Accomplish
Using data from global tourism and hospitality metrics, I am interested in:
- Predict tourism revenue based on key economic and service factors
- Predict customer return (churn) based on satisfaction and infrastructure
- Predict hotel category based on price, region, and visitor behavior

## Dataset

- Source: [Kaggle ‚Äì Tourism and Hospitality Industry Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/smithmurphy/tourism-and-hospitality-industry-analysis-dataset)
- 500 records with over 20 features across geographic, economic, and service dimensions
---

##  Tools & Libraries Used

- Python (Google Colab)
- `pandas`, `numpy`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`, `xgboost`
- GitHub for version control and presentation
---

## How to Run This Project

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab using the link below:
   [üîó Open Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13jBga0mskFeY6M4gKEQc_OMDmhQqihtT?usp=sharing)

2. Upload the CSV file (`Tourism_Hospitality_Industry_Analysis.csv`) to the Colab environment

3. Run cells from top to bottom to reproduce results:
   - Data cleaning & preprocessing
   - EDA with visualizations
   - Predictive modeling with 3 business questions
   - Performance evaluation and confusion matrices
